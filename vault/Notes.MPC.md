## Multiparty Computation(MPC) or Secure MPC (SMPC)

**Secure multi-party computation (SMPC)** is a cryptographic technique that allows multiple people to compute a function, where the function itself and its outputs are public, but the inputs are kept private to each person.

Terms:

* Threshold secret sharing
* Oblivious Transafer(OT)
* Private Set Intersection(PSI)

### Private Set Intersection(PSI)
> Maybe can be implemented in IoT devices.

### What is Oblivious Transafer(OT)

Oblivious Transfer (OT) has been a central primitive in the area of secure computation.
