# Welcome to Richard Notes

Collection of several different notes, related to classes, research, websites, apps and any other type of information I find useful.

<p>&nbsp;<img align="center" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=rhg101997&show_icons=true&theme=github_dark" alt="rhg101997" /></p>

## Expectations:

1. This site may contain many grammar errors and other language problems. Since this site is mostly to keep as notes in several topics I do not which to forget or to have faster access to that specific information.

2. Everything here is opinion based, or has been taking from several sources **Which may or may not be trusted**

3. Hopefully as my notes increase it will be helpful to me in the future or someone else. 

4. There is not specific order to the documentation included in this site either.
