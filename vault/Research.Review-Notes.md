## Notes Tips Review

WHen writing a paper your writing for others. How write it so that the intention passes to others

### Componets:

* Abstract
* summary
* Intro
- Background and Motivation of problem
- Descriptioon of the solution.
* Related work
- Compare your work to others
* Approach
- Technical
* Experiments
- Validation of the approach
* Conslusion


### Initial Scan

* Read the abstract
* Understand the TOpic, motivation, area, etc
* Every paper has story and it is **not** what they did

### Full Reading 

* Understand the details
* Especially
1. The approuch 
2. Experimentation

### Second Reading 

Section by section:

 Certain expectation are met?


## Expectation

### Introduction Check

> If reader not excited by intro, paper is lost

* dis they define the reseach challange and why id unquie/important
* Did they describe their appriuch's constribution?
* Are you able to follow the write up? Flow  the above points


### Related Work Check

Understand if the work is a repetition or new work?: In many cases solution exist and this gives you a rejection  justification to claim that the problem has alreafy been studied.

If different, then: Do they explain their work and how is differnt from others.
* Justification of new paper

### Approach Check

The most crucial section of the paper for the reviewes.

**Contribution**: is a new algorithms, protocol, architecture, analysis vulnerabilities, design, comparison, application of one theory  to to another domain, optimization, etc.

It is NOT an implemenation a product, etc

Exceptions: Experimetnal evelaution & survey papers (Contribution)

#### Evaluation Check

A realistic evaulation of the proposed approach.
* Most crucial part for reviews

What to watch for :

* Is there a realistic implementation of the approach? (High-less Priority)
1. Actual devices implemented
2. Emulation on real devices
3. SImulation with reaalistic tools(Check result)
4. Authors own code in anon realistc enviroment()
5. No implementation but just discussions(Reject)

* Is code avaible? Repeatability?
* Is there a comparision with  alternative approaches [Bechmarks, some kind of metrics.]
* Are the result making sense?
1. Any suspicius trends
2. Any result that were not put in the paper
3. Are result scalable? or corner case?
4. Are they significant? (repeated)(trade off)


#### Analystical Evaluation Check

Many cases, experiments are not enough:
* There is need for mathemetical analysis. Security, probabilistic, complexisty analisys
* This section is not mandatory but it will make the paper stronger

#### General Reader Perspective

* Writing less is more. 
* Do not overload reader with 40 graphs
* Do not overload reader with pages of equations
* Readers should not have to wor.

If paper is not readable  as an argument.
