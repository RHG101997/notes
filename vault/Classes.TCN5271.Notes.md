### Week 1: Introductions



### Week 2: Recap Networking

####  Trends

**Important**

* Realiazation of Iot advancement came from  microcontrollers, flash storage radio, communication, and sensors.
* Bell's law: every 10 years new type of computers
* Cyber-physical: Interaction with the physical world(control)(car)
* Ubiquitous Computing (Sensor and networks everywhere)

> Next Class(1/27): Come up with other interesting IoT application and IoT devices. (Wierd one) (UWB :) )

**Possible aplications:** medicine, entretainment, enterprises, home, traffic, emergency situation.

* Dedicated short range Comminication(DSRC): vehicle sommunication.(research)
* Remote control Beetle: US Army studies
* Soccer: Goal Detection
* GDPR

#### Characteristics of wireless networks

**Types**: Satellite, WAN, Mobile ad-hoc networks, 1G-5G, UWB ,etc

Challenges OF Wireless Computing:

    1. Wireless Communication
    2. Mobility
    3. Poor REsources dure to Portability


### Week 3

70% traffic is wireless in the internet

#### Wireless Challenges

1. limited transmission: 10m - 500m
2. Mosly Limited Bandwith: 
3. Disconnections: Network partition and stall all application.
4. Security: Easy to intrude in the network
5. Heterogeneous devices and network connections.
    * wired links
    * Outdoor: Radio
    * Indoor: Infrared
    * Rural Areas: Satellites

> HW: Measure the data RATE and which standard, cable provider

RG-6 100 MBps

Wireless enviroment is not deterministic  or stocastich(performance degragation)

Context-Aware systems: Depends on the context the behavior will change.




#### From QUiz:

Active Network: Aggressive networking

* **Important:** steps of evolution

* Iot is subset of CPS(Cyber-physical systems): False


### Week 3

#### What is Network

* Componets
* Inter - connecting multiple networks
* Intra - Within something
* Core - Medium used for networks to connect(Beltway)
* ISP - connect regions
* Miami ISP 
* Protocol - Semantics, timing, syntax

* Current model of the internet of Client-Server

* Peer-to-Peer: Bittorrent
* Wep3.0

#### Protocol 

OSI - Official
TCP/IP - Defacto(Everyone uses it but is not official)
SMPT - Simple mail transfer protocol
