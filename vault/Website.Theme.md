## Chirpy Jekyll theme

The theme `Chripy` is used on the main page of my site, it is a static website mainly for blogging, uses markdown to create notes and other. But I will use it mostly for the front, and notes will be written only on Dendron.

This theme is used mostly for proffessional writting, but in my case I just want a canvas to write ideas/code snippets that will be used for me later on. Cheatsheets, tips, and other important information.
