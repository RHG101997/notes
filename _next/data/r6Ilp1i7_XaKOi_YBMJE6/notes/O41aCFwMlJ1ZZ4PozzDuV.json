Depending on the conference, you may be asked to submit one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Abstract:</strong> Synopsis of your research (250 words or less)</li>\n<li><strong>Extended abstract:</strong> High-level summary of your research (less than 2 pages)</li>\n<li><strong>Brief or short paper:</strong> Summary of your research (less than 4 pages)</li>\n<li><strong>Full paper:</strong> Complete paper describing your research in full (6-8 pages)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"manuscript-types-acceptable-for-peer-review\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#manuscript-types-acceptable-for-peer-review\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Manuscript Types Acceptable for Peer Review</h3>\n<p><br><br>\n<strong>Regular</strong>: This is a classic research article that has a hypothesis, investigation, solution, model, physical experiment and/or simulation and a result that is of value to the community within that area of expertise.</p>\n<p><strong>Survey</strong>: A survey article analyzes, summarizes, systemizes, and presents fresh conclusions from a large number of recently published scholarly articles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Review</strong>: A review article or review paper is based on other published articles. It does not report original research.</li>\n<li><strong>SOK</strong>: papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as such papers can provide a high value to our community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Applied research</strong>: This article describes challenges and practical solutions for topics within the journalâ€™s scope. Quantitative results for validation of the approach are expected.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"rg4icNT5Vsmg1EL6OA9St","title":"Root","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"type":"note","desc":"","links":[],"anchors":{"welcome-to-richard-notes":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to Richard Notes","value":"welcome-to-richard-notes","line":7,"column":0,"depth":1},"expectations":{"type":"header","text":"Expectations:","value":"expectations","line":13,"column":0,"depth":2},"lookup":{"type":"header","text":"Lookup","value":"lookup","line":25,"column":0,"depth":2}},"fname":"root","updated":1643764409517,"created":1639763368541,"parent":null,"children":["3NyZZxlIgyYkAdFspeaa7","fTtWJ5vX5IBeAzAUYdPP7","txf4hm9604wz7w1lp62mftf","Yxu7iONfvtIznWlG30RdW","geg7mXgEX00anUWuV4pQI","ai0uHKgYsSb6TnNkTyqDU"],"data":{},"contentHash":"eda513562bc7ad64bd1d947c30dd61d8","custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"body":"# Welcome to Richard Notes\n\nCollection of several different notes, related to classes, research, websites, apps and any other type of information I find useful.\n\n<p>&nbsp;<img align=\"center\" src=\"https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=rhg101997&show_icons=true&theme=github_dark\" alt=\"rhg101997\" /></p>\n\n## Expectations:\n\n1.
