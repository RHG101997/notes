It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained (no external dependencies).</p>\n<p>Dear ImGui is designed to enable fast iterations and to empower programmers to create content creation tools and visualization / debug tools (as opposed to UI for the average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal, and lacks certain features normally found in more high-level libraries.</p>\n<p>Dear ImGui is particularly suited to integration in games engine (for tooling), real-time 3D applications, fullscreen applications, embedded applications, or any applications on consoles platforms where operating system features are non-standard.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-use-it\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#how-to-use-it\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>How to use it</h3>\n<p>The README.md file has good explanation on it:<a href=\"https://github.com/ocornut/imgui#usage\">Here</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-start\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#how-to-start\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>How to start</h3>\n<p>To be continued</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"rg4icNT5Vsmg1EL6OA9St","title":"Root","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"type":"note","desc":"","links":[],"anchors":{"welcome-to-richard-notes":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to Richard Notes","value":"welcome-to-richard-notes","line":7,"column":0,"depth":1},"expectations":{"type":"header","text":"Expectations:","value":"expectations","line":13,"column":0,"depth":2},"lookup":{"type":"header","text":"Lookup","value":"lookup","line":25,"column":0,"depth":2}},"fname":"root","updated":1643764409517,"created":1639763368541,"parent":null,"children":["3NyZZxlIgyYkAdFspeaa7","fTtWJ5vX5IBeAzAUYdPP7","txf4hm9604wz7w1lp62mftf","Yxu7iONfvtIznWlG30RdW","geg7mXgEX00anUWuV4pQI","ai0uHKgYsSb6TnNkTyqDU"],"data":{},"contentHash":"eda513562bc7ad64bd1d947c30dd61d8","custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"body":"# Welcome to Richard Notes\n\nCollection of several different notes, related to classes, research, websites, apps and any other type of information I find useful.\n\n<p>&nbsp;<img align=\"center\" src=\"https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=rhg101997&show_icons=true&theme=github_dark\" alt=\"rhg101997\" /></p>\n\n## Expectations:\n\n1.

Hopefully as my notes increase it will be helpful to me in the future or someone else. \n\n4.
